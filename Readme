A replicated file system using Raft protocol

Four basic functionalities are provided by this file system

Write, Cas, Delete are replicated across all raft nodes while read request requests will be satisfied locally without any 
replication.

       OK <version>
2. Read:
       read <filename>\r\n
    Read response:
       CONTENTS <version> <numbytes> <exptime> \r\n <content bytes>\r\n
